# trading-bot

Right here I have a fully functioning OANDA tradebot. In order to use you must do the following:
1. Fill in the ACCESS_TOKEN and ACCOUNT_ID with your actual information
2. Open terminal change directories into the directory with the file
3. run python trading_bot.py

This trading bot works based off of the momentum that is currently happening in the market. Every half an hour it checks the candles and will decide whether to close or continue an order accordingly
